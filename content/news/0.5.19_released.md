0.5.19 is a hotfix release that's coming so soon after 0.5.18 because it patches a bug in
the STL parser that causes models using STL meshes to consume a very very large amount
of memory.

Additionally, it adds a MacOS-specific bootup icon, adds support for negative scale factors
(a handy trick for mirroring meshes), makes it possible to toggle a single `ContactGeoemtry`
component through its `is_visible` toggle, replaces the custom `ExpressionBasedBushingForce`
frame visualization with OSC's in-built frame visualization (which is toggle-able), and
filters out any NaNed geometry coming from OpenSim (which can sometimes break OSC's hittest).
