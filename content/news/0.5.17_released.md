0.5.17 is a minor release that focuses on integrating HighDPI support into
OSC's various subsystems. Various engine assets and model meshes were also
removed, compressed, or decimated, roughly halving the size of OSC's
installers. Additionally, there's now an easier way to zero coordinates
in the coordinates panel (#959), the socket reassignment popup has had
a makeover (#957), and various little bugs/regressions were fixed (#958, #952).
