0.5.15 adds (ðŸª„ experimental) support for visualizing/linking experimental data,
which lets users combine OpenSim models, trajectories, raw experimental data, and
OpenSim tool files (e.g. ExternalLoads) in one place. It also improves the UI
in a variety of ways, mainly with the aim of eventually unifying previewing
experimental data, model editing, and viewing simulations in one workflow.
