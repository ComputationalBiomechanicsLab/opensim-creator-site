0.5.10 adds provisional support for `OpenSim::StationDefinedFrame`, which has
now been added to OpenSim and should become widely available with the release
of OpenSim 4.6. It also adds more options to the Calculate - primarily so that
the Fit Analytic Geometry to This can be used to extract similar values to
external scripts (e.g. the shape fitters from 10.1017/pab.2020.46).
